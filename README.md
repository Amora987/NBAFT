## What We're Creating
We are creating a set of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using the proper ERC Standards. Our NFT Collection will be based on smart contracts that we will code ourselves using the Remix IDE and Solidity programming language. The NFTs will contain a set of 3 randomized words and each one will of course be unique. We chose this as our project to showcase our understanding of Solidity, Smart Contracts and working with the blockchain in general. 

## What Is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This differs from fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can serve as a medium for commercial transactions.
